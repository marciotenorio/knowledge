# Inheritance

# Abstract Class
Use an abstract class when you want to provide a default behavior that subclasses can extend or override.\
When there are shared characteristics and behaviors among a group of related classes.

# Interface

Use interfaces when you want to specify a set of methods that a class must implement.\
When different unrelated classes need to implement common behavior without being forced into a hierarchy.

# Polymorphism
