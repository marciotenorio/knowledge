/** 
 * The Lexical Environment object consists of two parts:
 * 1. Environment Record â€“ an object that stores all local variables as 
 * its properties (and some other information like the value of this).
 * 2. A reference to the outer lexical environment, the one associated with the outer code.
 * 
 * When scripts start existis the "uninitialized" state to variables. 
 * Function are ready-to-use unlike variable, that is unusable untill the declaration
 * but only in function declaration not function expressions.
 * 
 * If a code want to access a variable that don't exists in anywhere in strict mode an error
 * are throw and in non-strict-mode creates a global variable to compartibility with old code. 
 * 
 * All functions remember the Lexical Environment in which they were made.

 * That is: they automatically remember where they were created using a hidden 
 * [[Environment]] property, and then their code can access outer variables.
