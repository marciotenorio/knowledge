# Algorithms and Data Structures

### Basics

Some definitions to remember:
- Data, register, memory, bit, byte, word, instruction, algorithm and process.

- Process (Stack, Heap, Code Segment->Machine code and Data Segment->Global and static variables)

- Static allocation -> Compile time || Dynamic Allocation -> Runtime

- Function/Method Stack (Parameters, return and local variables). At the end all data are erased
from memory.

- Recursive function problem -> Data redundancy in memory.

- All pointers have same size, 8 bytes (0x00A). Explore about ptr size, content, etc.

- When free some pointer, assign null after to prevent access to this content.

- Allocation memory problems: Segmentation fault, memory leak and hard debug;

- Array -> Uniform data type and sequential || Struct -> not homogeneous data block
